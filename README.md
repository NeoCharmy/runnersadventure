##What is this?
an embeded version of Sonic runners adventure java port, thanks to this Awesome [freej2me-web](https://github.com/zb3/freej2me-web) 
project so make sure to visit it if you want to have yours anywhere you want! just give it a minute to load.

[PLAY NOW](https://neocharmy.github.io/runnersadventure/web/run.html?app=Sonic%20Runners%20Adventure&fractionScale=1)

note that the mentioned project also supports vitrual buttons but I've just choose this full touch version for better experience

##The game crashes?
It will jump out of the game at some point of level 5 
there's also chance that can happen on level 4
it's something different than just crashing & I'll try to solve this later
the other games mostly should be fine
