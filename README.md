## What is this?
an embeded version of Sonic runners adventure java port, thanks to this Awesome [freej2me-web](https://github.com/zb3/freej2me-web) 
project so make sure to visit it if you want to have yours anywhere you want! just give it a minute to load.

[PLAY NOW](https://neocharmy.github.io/runnersadventure/web/run.html?app=Sonic%20Runners%20Adventure&fractionScale=1)

note that the mentioned project also supports vitrual buttons but I've just choose this full touch version for better experience

## full screen?
I'm pretty sure you know about the F11 my friend, but if it doesn't work, do it on another tab & then back to game.
  
about mobiles, just copy & save this as a bookmark, & while you're in game, choose your saved bookmark from address bar:

<clipboard-copy for="blob-path">Copy</clipboard-copy>
<div id="blob-path">javascript:(function() { document.documentElement.requestFullscreen(); })();</div>

## The game crashes?
It will jump out of the game at some point of level 5 
there's also chance that can happen on level 4
it's something different than just crashing & I'll try to solve this later
the other games mostly should be fine
