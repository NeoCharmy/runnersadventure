## What is this?
an embeded version of Sonic runners adventure java port, thanks to this Awesome [freej2me-web](https://github.com/zb3/freej2me-web) 
project so make sure to visit it if you want to have yours anywhere you want! just give it a minute to load.

note that the mentioned project also supports vitrual buttons & keyboard but I've just choose this full touch version here for better experience.  
& also this page won't stay like this forever & I'll maybe try to create a full site for some embeded games in future or something. I'm not sure  

  
## fullscreen?
I'm pretty sure you know about the F11 my friend, but if it doesn't work, do it on another tab & then back to game.
  
about mobiles, just copy & save this as a bookmark, & while you're in game, choose your saved bookmark from address bar:

```
javascript:(function() { document.documentElement.requestFullscreen(); })();
```

  
## Does The game crash?
It will jump out of the game at some point of level 5 
& there's also chance that can happen on level 4.  
it's something different than just any crashing & I'll try to solve this later...if i can that is.  
the other games mostly should be fine anyway


## Dark mode?
it's not officially supported yet & has been added manually for now
